## Introduction

The Rust HTTP Request and Error Handling program demonstrates how to make an HTTP GET request using the `reqwest` crate and handle potential errors effectively. It fetches data from the "http://httpbin.org/get" URL and provides insights into the response, including status, headers, and the response body.

## Error Handling

We've implemented error handling using the `error_chain` crate to provide clear and concise error messages. The main error types include:

- `Io`: Represents errors related to input and output operations.
- `HttpRequest`: Handles errors related to HTTP requests using the `reqwest` library.

## How it Works

This program performs the following steps:

1. Sends an HTTP GET request to the "http://httpbin.org/get" URL using the `reqwest` crate.
2. Retrieves and prints the HTTP response's status code, headers, and body.
3. Handles any errors that may occur during the request or response processing, providing informative error messages.

## Usage

To use the Rust HTTP Request and Error Handling program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-request-error-handling.git
   cd http-request-error-handling
   ```

3. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the program, send an HTTP GET request to "http://httpbin.org/get," and display the response details, including status, headers, and body.
